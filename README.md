Learning to use the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi

This repository may help all of you guys interested in Shell Scripting in Linux who may like to try things out on your own Raspberry Pi.
All of the code untill now should work in the Raspberry Pi B+ and the Pi 2, since the pin arrangement is similar.

Just download the code and give it permission using chmod +ax.
To run it, ./[filename], where in this case we have not given any extension to the files since it is not necessary and makes it easy to
identify in a large directory.

List of Programs
1.Blinking - Just blinking a light connected to ground and the 4th pin.
2.Push Button - Light stays on if the push button is pressed once, if pressed again, it will go off. (Toggle the light).
3.Push Button 2 - Keeps the lights on untill the push button is held on, this is without using any pull up resister.
